# nf-core/configs maestro eager specific configuration

Extra specific configuration for eager pipeline for human DNA data processing

## Usage

To use, run the pipeline with `-profile maestro,<qos>,<type>`, where qos can be normal or long and type can be nuclear or mitochondrial

This will download and launch the eager specific [`maestro.config`](../../../conf/pipeline/eager/maestro.config) which has been pre-configured with a setup suitable for the Maestro cluster.

Example: `nextflow run nf-core/eager -profile maestro,normal,nuclear`

## eager specific configurations for maestro

Specific configurations for maestro has been made for eager.

We decided not to provide any tool parameters here, and focus the profile only for resource management: Maestro profiles runs with default nf-core/eager parameters, but with modifications concerning time (limit to 24h in normal qos, so increasing the memory and CPUs, specially for alignments).

## nuclear

Increases the number of CPUs and the amount of memory for key processes

## mitochondrial

More limited computational resources

## unlimitedtime

Every process has one year time limit. To be used only when some processes can not be completed for time reasons when using mitochondrial or nuclear profiles.
Expect slow processes when using this profile because only 5 CPUs are available at a time.
