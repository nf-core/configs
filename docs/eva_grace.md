# nf-core/configs: EVA_GRACE Configuration

All nf-core pipelines have been successfully configured for use on the GRACE cluster at the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (MPI-EVA)](http://eva.mpg.de).

To use, run the pipeline with `-profile eva_grace`. You can further with optimise submissions by specifying which cluster queue you are using e,g, `-profile eva_grace`. This will download and launch the [`eva_grace.config`](../conf/eva_grace.config) which has been pre-configured with a setup suitable.

## Instructions

Before running `nextflow run...` make sure to activate either the singularity (older pipelines, e.g. nf-core/eager v2) or apptainer (recent pipelines) with:

```bash
module load singularity
```

or

```bash
module load apptainer
```
