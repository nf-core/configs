# nf-core/configs Maestro (at Pateur Institute, Paris) Configuration

To use, run the pipeline with `-profile maestro,<qos>` (with qos being long or normal). This will download and launch the maestro.config which has been pre-configured with a setup suitable for the Maestro cluster on either the long or normal qos.
Using one of these profiles, a docker image containing all of the required software will be downloaded, and converted to a Singularity image before execution of the pipeline
