# nf-core/configs: Marvin Configuration

All nf-core pipelines have been successfully configured for use on the [Marvin HPC cluster of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF)](https://www.upf.edu/web/sct-sit/marvin-cluster). To use, run the pipeline with -profile marvin.

NB: You will need an account to use the HPC cluster on the Marvin cluster in order to run the pipeline. If in doubt contact IT. NB: Nextflow will need to submit the jobs via the SLURM scheduler to the HPC cluster and as such the commands above will have to be executed on one of the head nodes. If in doubt contact IT.

## Pipeline Specific profiles

There are no specific profiles added for now
