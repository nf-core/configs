# nf-core/configs: Cambridge HPC Configuration

All nf-core pipelines have been successfully configured for use on the Cambridge HPC cluster at the [The University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).  
To use, run the pipeline with `-profile cambridge`. This will download and launch the [`cambridge.config`](../conf/cambridge.config) which has been pre-configured
with a setup suitable for the Cambridge HPC cluster. Using this profile, either a docker image containing all of the required software will be downloaded,
and converted to a Singularity image or a Singularity image downloaded directly before execution of the pipeline.

### Install Nextflow

The latest version of Nextflow is not installed by default on the Cambridge HPC cluster CSD3. You can install it with conda:

```
module load miniconda/3

# set up Bioconda according to the Bioconda documentation, notably setting up channels
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge

# create the environment env_nf, and install the tool nextflow
conda create --name env_nf nextflow

# activate the environment containing nextflow
conda activate env_nf

# once done with the environment, deactivate
conda deactivate
```

Alternatively, you can install Nextflow into a directory you have write access to.
Follow [these instructions](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#) from the Nextflow documentation. This alternative method requires also to update java.

```
# move to desired directory on HPC
cd /home/<username>/path/to/dir

# get the newest version
wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash

# update java version to the latest
wget https://download.oracle.com/java/20/latest/jdk-20_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
tar xvfz jdk-20_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz

# if all tools are compatible with the java version you chose, add these lines to .bashrc
export JAVA_HOME=/home/<username>/path/to/dir/jdk-20.0.1
export PATH=/home/<username>/path/to/dir/jdk-20.0.1/bin:$PATH

# Once above is done `java --version` should return `java 20.0.1 2023-04-18`
java --version

```

### Set up Singularity cache

Singularity allows the use of containers and will use a caching strategy. First, you might want to set the `NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` bash environment variable, pointing at your hpc-work location. If not, it will be automatically assigned to the current directory.

```
# do this once per login, or add these lines to .bashrc
export NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/home/<username>/rds/hpc-work/path/to/cache/dir
```

Once done, and ready to use Nextflow, you can check that the Singularity module is loaded by default when logging on the cluster.

```
module list

# If singularity is not loaded:
module load singularity
```

### Run Nextflow

Here is an example with the nf-core pipeline sarek ([read documentation here](https://nf-co.re/sarek/3.3.2)).
The user includes the project name and the node.

```
# Launch the nf-core pipeline for a test database
# with the Cambridge profile
nextflow run nf-core/sarek -profile test,cambridge.config --partition "cclake" --project "NAME-SL3-CPU" --outdir nf-sarek-test
```

All of the intermediate files required to run the pipeline will be stored in the `work/` directory. It is recommended to delete this directory after the pipeline
has finished successfully because it can get quite large, and all of the main output files will be saved in the `results/` directory anyway.

> NB: You will need an account to use the Cambridge HPC cluster in order to run the pipeline. If in doubt contact IT.
> NB: Nextflow will need to submit the jobs via SLURM to the Cambridge HPC cluster and as such the commands above will have to be executed on one of the login
> nodes. If in doubt contact IT.
