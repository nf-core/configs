# nf-core/configs: Roslin Configuration

This profile is similar to the 'eddie' profile managed by the IGC team, but focusssed towards eddie/nf-core users at Roslin.
nf-core pipelines sarek, rnaseq, chipseq, mag, differentialabundance and isoseq have all been tested on the University of Edinburgh Eddie HPC with test profile.

## Getting help

There is a Teams group dedicated to Nextflow users: [Nextflow Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3A7e957d32ce1345b8989af14564547690%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=446c509d-b8fd-466c-a66f-52122f0a2fcc&tenantId=2e9f06b0-1669-4589-8789-10a06934dc61)
Also, you can find at the coding club held each Wednesday: [Code Club Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A1bf9220112e445c382b6beb660ffb61a%40thread.tacv2/Coding%20Club?groupId=cc7a1113-38a1-48f6-9fc6-14700c8da27e&tenantId=2e9f06b0-1669-4589-8789-10a06934dc61)
Please also contact the Roslin Bioinformatics team with questions and we'll try to help: https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/spaces/RosBio/pages/602179073/Roslin+Bioinformatics+Home
We also have some notes on running the rnaseq pipeline (and of course much applies to all nf-core pipelines) here: https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/spaces/RosBio/pages/649925054/Nextflow+and+nf-core

## Using the Roslin config profile

To use, run the pipeline with `-profile roslin` (one hyphen).
This will download and launch the [`roslin.config`](../conf/roslin.config) file which has been pre-configured with a setup suitable for the [University of Edinburgh Eddie HPC](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/research-computing/ecdf/high-performance-computing).

The configuration file supports running nf-core pipelines with Docker containers running under Singularity by default. Conda is not currently supported.

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/PIPELINE -profile roslin # ...rest of pipeline flags
```

Before running the pipeline, you will need to load Nextflow from the module system or activate your Nextflow conda environment. Generally, the most recent version will be the one you want.

To list versions:

```bash
module avail -C Nextflow
```

To load the most recent version (28/10/2015):

```bash
module load roslin/nextflow/25.04.6
```

This config enables Nextflow to manage the pipeline jobs via the SGE job scheduler and using Singularity / apptainer for software management.

## Apptainer (/Singularity) set up

We have now (from August 2025) configured the roslin profile to use apptainer rather than singularity in the worker node jobs. This works better for us on Eddie with Nextflow and the nf-core pipelines. The roslin profile is set to use `/exports/cmvm/eddie/eb/groups/alaw3_eb_singularity_cache` as the apptainer (/singularity) cache directory. This directory is put at the disposition of roslin institute nextflow/nf-core users by the Roslin Bioinformatics group led by Andy Law. If an SGE project code is setup (see next section for more information), all new containers will be cached in this directory. Otherwise, the apptainers containers will be stored in the work directory created when Nextflow is run. If you face any problem with singularity cache, please contact [Sébastien Guizard](sguizard@ed.ac.uk), [Donald Dunbar](donald.dunbar@ed.ac.uk) and [Andy Law](andy.law@roslin.ed.ac.uk) with the [Roslin Bioinformatics](roslin.bioinformatics@roslin.ed.ac.uk) group in CC.

Apptainer/Singularity will by default create a directory `.singularity` in your `$HOME` directory on eddie. Space on `$HOME` is very limited, so it is a good idea to create a directory somewhere else with more room and link the locations.

```bash
cd $HOME
mkdir /exports/eddie/path/to/my/area/.singularity
ln -s /exports/eddie/path/to/my/area/.singularity .singularity
```

## SGE project set up

By default, users’ jobs are started with the `uoe_baseline` project that gives access to free nodes. If you have a project code that gives you access to paid nodes. It can be used by jobs submitted by Nextflow. To do so, you need to set up an environment variable called `NFX_SGE_PROJECT`:

```bash
export NFX_SGE_PROJECT="<PROJECT_NAME_HERE>"
```

If you wish, you place this variable declaration in your `.bashrc` file located in your home directory to automatically set it up each time you log on Eddie.

**NB:** This will work only with the roslin profile.

## Running Nextflow

### On a login node

You can use a qlogin to run Nextflow, if you request more than the default 2 GB of memory. Unfortunately, you can't submit the initial Nextflow run process as a job as you can't qsub within a qsub.
If your eddie terminal disconnects your Nextflow job will stop. You can run qlogin in a screen session to prevent this.

Start a new screen session.

```bash
screen -S <session_name>
```

Start an interactive job with qlogin.

```bash
qlogin -l h_vmem=8G
```

You can leave our screen session by typing Ctrl + A, then d.

To list existing screen sessions, use:

```bash
screen -ls
```

To reconnect to an existing screen session, use:

```bash
screen -r <session_name>
```

### On the wild west node

Wild West node has relaxed restriction compared to regular nodes, which allows the execution of Nextflow.
The access to Wild West node must be requested to [Andy Law](andy.law@roslin.ed.ac.uk) and IS.
Similarly to the qlogin option, it is advised to run Nextflow within a screen session.
