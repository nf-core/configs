# nf-core/configs: IFB core Configuration

All nf-core pipelines have been successfully configured for use on the cluster of the IFB (Institut Francais de Bioinformatique).

To use, run the pipeline with `-profile ifb_core`. This will download and launch the [`ifb_core.config`](../conf/ifb_core.config) which has been pre-configured with a setup suitable for the IFB core cluster. Using this profile, a docker image containing all of the required software will be downloaded, and converted to a Singularity image before execution of the pipeline.

## How to use on IFB core

Before running the pipeline you will need to load Nextflow using the environment module system on IFB core. You can do this by issuing the commands below:

```bash
# Login to a compute node
srun --pty bash

## Load Nextflow and Singularity environment modules
module purge
module load nextflow/20.04.1

# Run a downloaded/git-cloned nextflow workflow from
nextflow run \\
nf-core/workflow \\
-resume
-profile ifb_core \\
--email my-email@example.org  \\
-c my-specific.config
...


# Or use the nf-core client
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq ...

```

## Databanks

A local copy of several genomes are available in `/shared/bank` directory. See
our [databank page](https://ifb-elixirfr.gitlab.io/cluster/doc/banks/)
to search for your favorite genome.

>NB: You will need an account to use the HPC cluster on IFB core in order to run the pipeline. If in doubt contact IT or go to [account page](https://my.cluster.france-bioinformatique.fr/manager2/login).
